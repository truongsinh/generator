The repository\r\ncontains a simple test HTML page. Just open it in the browser you want to test support for; if\r\neverything's green, everything's good. I regularly check the current versions of Chrome, Firefox,\r\nOpera, Safari, and Internet Explorer (in the latter, also various emulation modes for IE8, IE7\r\netc).\r\n\r\n#Documentation\r\n* [Creating generators](/tran-nguyen/generator/blob/master/doc/creating_generators.md)\r\n* Methods exposed by generator objects\r\n* Caveats\r\n* Yield versus this.yield\r\n\r\n#Contribute\r\nSo go ahead: Try it, use it, and please give feedback and suggestions. Bug reports, patches and new\r\nideas will be very much appreciated!\r\n\r\n#Credit\r\n<to be updated>"}
